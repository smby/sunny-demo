# Build Plan (Implemented)

## Objective
Demonstrate trust-building capability for Sunny's main business:
- take raw B2B furniture/lighting lead data
- score and explain fit/intent
- generate outreach drafts
- export execution-ready assets

## Scope Delivered (V1)
1. CSV ingestion workflow
2. Lead scoring + tiering (A/B/C)
3. Explainable rationale and score breakdown
4. Outreach generation (template mode)
5. Optional AI-generated outreach mode (backend key)
6. Downloadable ranked CSV and markdown report
7. Presentation-ready UI for live demo
8. EN/CN language toggle across UI and generated outreach content

## What V1 Proves
- Fast initiative and practical delivery
- Explainable decision-making (not black-box)
- Immediate sales utility (rank + outreach + export)

## Next Iteration
1. Real-source ingestion (Apollo/Houzz/manual normalization)
2. Contact validation and dedupe
3. CRM schema mapping (HubSpot/Salesforce)
4. Response feedback loop to tune scoring
5. Shopify/Ads signal ingestion for deeper prioritization
